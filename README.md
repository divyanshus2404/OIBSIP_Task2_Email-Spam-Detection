# Email Spam Detection

This repository contains a Python implementation for detecting spam emails using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various classification algorithms to identify and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones. 

## Overview

The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. It demonstrates the use of different classification algorithms to classify emails into spam or non-spam (ham) categories. The following algorithms are implemented:

- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

## Project Structure

- `spam_detection.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with code for data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `spam_emails.csv` - CSV file containing the dataset with labeled emails (spam and ham). (Adjust the filename if your dataset differs.)
- `requirements.txt` - List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
